#X text 14 134 Hrmmm \, didn't work right...;
#X text 13 163 In Pd \, connection order is determined by *creation
order*. In the example above \, [print B] fires before [print A] because
the connection to [print A] was created *after* the connection to [print
B] when the patch was created.;

the [trigger] object \, see 1.Basics.pd -> MESSAGE ORDER.`;

#X text 19 151 Also \, Pd is an open source project without direct
\, paid support \, so additional features are often left off in order
to focus developer resources on object improvements and (constant)
maintenance.;
#X text 19 213 If you want to help improve Pd \, by all means do so!
Open an issue on the Github repository and/or post to the pd-list:

#X text 19 49 The cross-platform windowing toolkit used by PD for the
GUI \, Tk \, is realtively old and less modern than many newer \, fancier
UIs such as JUCE used by Max \, however it works on many systems and
uses less resources.;

your patch looks?;

#X text 18 18 Most versions of Max comes with Jitter included. Pd does
not come with a graphics environment \, by default.;
#X text 18 57 Pd's closest equivalent is the GEM (Graphics Environment
for Multimedia) external library which provides a thin wrapper around
OpenGL:;
#X text 41 264 3 Click on the newest highlighted (black) entry;
#X text 41 216 1 Open Help -> Find Externals;
#X text 41 240 2 Type "gem" into the search box & hit enter;
#X text 20 294 CYCLONE should then be downloaded to your ~/Documents/Pd/externals
directory.;
#X text 20 333 To start experimenting \, open the cyclone directory
in the Help Browser:;

#X text 41 422 3 Open the help patches for each available object;
#X text 22 176 Like the CYCLONE external library \, GEM can be installed
via the "deken" download manager:;
#X text 21 135 NOTE: As of 2022 \, some systems are deprecating support
for OpenGL \, so GEM may not work everywhere.;

;
#X text 16 86 Help Browser: Help -> Browser for references and help
patches found in path;
#X text 16 120 Similar to Max \, there is a learning curve which requires
learning those common building-block objects \, however there is no
auto-complete when typing an object name. There is \, however \, an
easy to find list of all core Pd objects:;

#X text 16 199 Also \, right-click on any Pd object and choose Help
to open it's help patch (if found):;
#X text 17 264 This works for custom abstractions too \, such as hello.pd
included in this folder:;

;
#X text 23 448 Also \, many users will share there own abstraction
libraries for some of these common use cases \, so searching online

#X text 13 12 If you *really miss* some objects available in Max but
not available in Pd \, there is the external object CYCLONE library
which ports a subset of Max objects to Pd.;
#X text 13 62 CYCLONE is a library of objects written in C which is
provided either as source code (harder) or in pre-compiled binary form
(easier).;
#X text 13 112 The quickets way to get a copy of CYCLONE \, is to use
the "deken" external library downloader built into to Pd:;
