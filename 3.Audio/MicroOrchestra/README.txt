electroacoustic laptop performance using Pure Data.

In order to run these, you will need Pure Data which you can download from: http://puredata.info

External Libraries
------------------

There are many additional objects that can be added to Pure Data, either from compiled source code or resuable patch abstractions. The rj/c_ead.pd patch is an example of the patch-based approach. You can also download & install externals using Help -> Find externals.

One thing to know is that Pd needs to know where these libraries are located when it tries to create objects.
